# Intro to Chatbots

Understanding conversations between people seems rather simple, but it is deceptively complex. Those who have attempted to write computer programs that converse with people understand how complex it is. We have a lot to learn about programming conversations between machines and humans, whether through text or voice. Still, a lot of improvements are being made in this area. For this project you will make a chatbot and wrestle with the many ambiguities of programming natural language interactions.

But will we ever be able to talk to things like we talk to people? Let\'s face it. Right now, most voice user interfaces fall a little short of being, well, conversational. In this video, we take a look at what happens when two humans have a conversation. Once we can understand that, letâ€™s figure out how we can apply it to modern interfaces. \\n\\nWant to learn more and be part of a conversational future?
