# Chatbot Introduction

Understanding conversations between people seems rather simple, but it is deceptively complex. Those who have attempted to write computer programs that converse with people understand how complex it is. We have a lot to learn about programming conversations between machines and humans, whether through text or voice. Still, a lot of improvements are being made in this area. For this project you will make a chatbot and wrestle with the many ambiguities of programming natural language interactions.

**DISCUSSION:**  What chatbots have you used? How well did the interaction go?
