# 3.3 App Refinements

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓  INSTRUCTIONS & DELIVERABLE" %}
It is important to determine how you can get the most return \(improvements in the chatbot\) from the time you have remaining to work. So, based on your evaluation findings and chatbot usage analysis, determine a plan to implement improvements while frequently testing to ensure nothing is unintentionally broken. Similar to your code requirements document earlier, simply list items by priority, with high priority changes and low priority changes.

This would also be a good time to revisit your [_Feature Map_](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1oL9Wdbm0lDgp38PGO_dnXa47X32P92EbYNgvauZeF98/edit?usp=sharing) if you created one earlier.

**❏ Deliverable**  
A document or slide listing improvements by priority.
