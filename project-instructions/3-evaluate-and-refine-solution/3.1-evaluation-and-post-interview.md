# 3.1 Evaluation and Post Interview

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓  INSTRUCTIONS & DELIVERABLE" %}
Plan another evaluation to test your live chatbot using the **think-aloud protocol** with at least six people. While you did a basic functional test \(code testing\) earlier, this evaluation will help you determine if the chatbot is fully usable _and engaging for people_. You also want to evaluate the quality of the chatbot messages and feedback. Follow up this evaluation with an informal **post interview** of participants to get feedback on the overall effectiveness of your solution in addressing your chosen health issue. You want to learn as much as you can while using people's time wisely and respectfully.
