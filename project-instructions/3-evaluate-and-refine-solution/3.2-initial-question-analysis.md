After making any improvements to your chatbot from the user evaluation in your previous exercise, share your chatbot link with classmates and others outside of class to generate some data on chat behaviors. Prepare summary data and charts on people's interactions with your chatbot and draw some conclusions about the quality of the interactions and any inferences that can be made about visitors' mental models. Look for any patterns indicating errors in your chatbot script or functions.
