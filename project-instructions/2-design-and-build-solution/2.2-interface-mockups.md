| **Interface mockups** are provided but lack detail, not demonstrating a unique visual perspective on the basic trivia template design. | The interface mockups demonstrate a thoughtful concept design and provides a good representation for ideas and feedback from participants. | The mockups are exceptional in representing and evaluating some novel concepts, or a couple variations of concepts are presented to compare. |
