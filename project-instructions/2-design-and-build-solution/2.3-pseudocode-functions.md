# 2.3 Pseudocode Functions

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓  INSTRUCTIONS & DELIVERABLE" %}
Create [pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode) for each programming function your chatbot will need to perform your defined tasks.

Resource:[ Pseudocode on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode)

See the example pseudocode below as a guide. Don't worry about syntax. Pseudocode is meant to describe, in plain english, what you will need the computer to process.

```diff
function: calculate ingredient amounts for recipe    
    - read ingredient amounts for a single serving from database    
    - read number of servings desired by user    
    - multiply number of servings by the single serving amounts    
    - return result
```

| The pseudocode is incomplete and doesn't clearly describe what each function will do. | The pseudocode clearly defines the basic operations of each chatbot function, providing a good template for coding the Javascript functions. | The pseudocode provides a detailed description of each function that thoughtfully considers the logic needed for the programming. |
