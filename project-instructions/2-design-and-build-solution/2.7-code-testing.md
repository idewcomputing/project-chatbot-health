# 2.8 Code Testing

{% tab title="✓  INSTRUCTIONS & DELIVERABLE" %}
Conduct some basic code testing to verify that the app is acting as expected under different conditions. Ensure that everything works as expected on different size screens and with touch or mouse interactions. 

Consider all the things a user might do with your chatbot--like common misspellings, sending an empty message, sending a seemingly random message, or maybe sending calls for help \("help", "reset",  "what?", etc.\)

Make a simple checklist of conditions you will test to verify that your chatbot works as expected and handles some unintended \(but somewhat foreseeable\) user responses. Then one by one test each condition while playing the part of a visitor that is new to your chatbot.

| **The code testing documentation** has been completed but lacks detail or an accurate evaluation of the code quality. | The code testing is complete, accurately represents the state of the application's development, and is useful in identifying needed improvements. | The code testing is very thorough and goes beyond the standard testing items provided in the example. |
